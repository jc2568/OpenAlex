# OpenAlex

The OpenAlex repository primarily stores scripts (e.g., Python, Bash, and Perl) that were utilized to construct the OpenAlex dataset. OpenAlex is an open-source
database (https://openalex.org/) that our group uses to facilitate the final output found on the Reliance on Science website (https://zenodo.org/record/7497435).
All the Python and Bash scripts were authored by Joshua Chu. The Perl scripts were also modified by Joshua Chu to work with a new server directory network and new
data format from OpenAlex (Perl scripts were authored by Matt Marx and collaborators).

Slurm was the workload manager used in our group, and 'slurm scripts' were written to parallelize the processes for many of the steps during dataset construction.

Different resources were used to aid in script development: GitHub, Stack Overflow, Geeks for Geeks (Python and Bash), and many O'Reilly books.
